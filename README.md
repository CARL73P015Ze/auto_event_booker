# auto_event_booker
Auto Event Booker, allow someone to bulk book events based on working days and users.  Biggest first. C#


This has a quick UI prototype that allows someone to visual see what the outcome would be - see screenshot (before.PNG, after.PNG). The palegoldenrod colour show the available booking area, the grey shows the existing booked event, the green shows the auto-booked events.


It only uses an in-memory datastore, it would be fairly simple to switch the datastore to SQL (I might do that in a differrent branch, i would need to properly implement GRASP).
